<h1>Data structures</h1>

This contains several standard data structures which I have written based on standard implementations.
Currently includes:
- fenwick_tree.py- Implementation of Fenwick tree data structure (aka Binary Indexed Tree or BIT).
- heap.py- Implementation of max heap data structure based on the Python list.
- prime_sieves.py- Defines a class based around a prime sieve (Sieve of Eratosthenes) recording the smallest prime factor of each integer, with methods that use this prime sieve to perform calculations including prime factorisation, finding all possible factorisations not including 1 as a factor, generating primes and evaluating the prime counting function.
- segment_tree.py- Implementation of segment tree data structure.

These are intended for revision and reference.

Written using Python 3.6.
