<h1>Algorithms</h1>

This contains several standard algorithms which I have written based on standard implementations.
Currently includes:
- array_algorithms.py- Currently only includes the Boyer-Moore majority voting algorithm
- graph_algorithms.py- Includes minimal path algorithms for weighted graphs and digraphs (e.g. Dijkstra, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford) as well as algorithms for non-weighted digraphs (e.g. Kahn's algorithm and Tarjan's algorithm for strongly connected components, bridges and articulation points)
- random_selection_algorithms.py- Currently only includes an algorithm for uniformly randomly selecting a subset of a range of integers
- string_searching_algorithms.py- Implementation of standard string searching algorithms including KMP, Z-algorithm, Aho-Corasick and rolling hash

These are intended for revision and reference.

Written using Python 3.6.
