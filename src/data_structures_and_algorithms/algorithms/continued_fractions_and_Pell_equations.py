                value of D).
                Note that the solution to Pell's equation with the same
                D value used must have strictly positive x and y values
                but given that if (x, y) is a solution, then so are
                (-x, y), (x, -y) and (-x, -y), rather than throwing an
                error if one or both components is negative, the
                absolute value for both components is used.
            Default: None
    
    Returns:
    List of 2-tuples of ints, where each 2-tuple (x1, y1) represents
    exactly two distinct solutions to the generalised Pell's equation
    for the given D and n, namely:
        x = x1 and y = y1
        x = -x1 and y = -y1
    Collectively, the solutions represented by the elements of the list
    form a fundamental solution set of the generalised Pell's equation
    for the given D and n corresponding to the solution to Pell's
    equation with the same D value pell_basic_sol if this is given as
    not None or the fundamental solution to that Pell's equation
    otherwise.
    An empty list signifies that the generalised Pell's equation for
    the given D and n has no integer solutions.
    
    Outline of rationale/proof:
    See https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu/blurbs/ugradnumthy/pelleqn2.pdf
    In this paper, Theorem 3.3 implies that for any solution (x0, y0)
    of Pell's equation for given D there exists a corresponding
    fundamental solution set for the generalised Pell's equation with
    given D and n that is a subset of the solutions (x, y) of this
    generalised Pell's equation such that:
        abs(y) <= sqrt(abs(n)) * (sqrt(u) + 1 / sqrt(u)) / (2 * sqrt(D))
    where:
        u = x0 + sqrt(D) * y0
    We therefore check all y values within these bounds using the
    fundamental solution to Pell's equation for this D to find these
    solutions, the set of which contains as a subset a fundamental
    solution set for this generalised Pell's equation.
